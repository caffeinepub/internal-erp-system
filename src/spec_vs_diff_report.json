  "summary": "Diff primarily adds global Radix Dialog/AlertDialog/Sheet overlay and content styling in `frontend/src/index.css` (stronger dimming, solid modal surfaces, z-index), and updates several dialog/sheet usages plus app shell header/nav styling/z-index to reduce visual overlap. However, the diff also includes multiple unrelated feature/UI changes (e.g., backup import/export hooks/module, finance reporting enhancements, login/footer version labels) that were not requested.",
