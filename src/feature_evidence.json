      "featureTitle": "Redesign the app UI/UX into a Vyapar-like (but legally distinct) prototype by updating layout, navigation, and key screens while keeping existing ERP functionality intact (products, inventory, contacts, billing/estimates, purchasing, finance/reports, printing). The redesign must change the overall information architecture and visual patterns enough to avoid any 1:1 copying of Vyapar screens, while still providing a familiar business-ledger workflow (fast entry, prominent totals, clear lists, quick actions).",
